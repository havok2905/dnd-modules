            <p>
                Attempting to fly over New Fey will cause the players to get
                view of a fleet of small airships hovering in the air, five in
                total. They are all unmarked and can be seen from five hundred
                feet away.
            </p>
            <p>
                These ships are owned by the Order of the Profane soul and they
                will avoid conflict unless provoked or they gain knowledge that
                you are also in search of the temple.
            </p>
            <h2>The Flagship</h2>
            <p>
                The largest of the five has the leader of the order onboard. In
                his possession is a tome depicting Enkiem's slaying of Maren, as
                Maren was left to die. Maren outlines in this tome the ways in
                which the gods are vulnerable and her hope in mortals eventually
                overcoming this obstacle. She outlines explicit directions to
                Ao's temple, and the trials that lay ahead.
