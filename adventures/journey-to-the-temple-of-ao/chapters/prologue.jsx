            <EmphasisBlock>
                <p>
                    We see a bluejay landing on a crooked branch, fluttering
                    it's wings as it's talons grip on the brittle bark. It takes
                    a moment to rest it's wings, tired from a long flight
                    through the clouds. The chill wind wraps around the tiny
                    creature, dusting it with a thin white layer of snow. This
                    peace does not last long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wood splinters in all directions as the mound of titanic
                    flesh rips the tree apart. The bluejay takes flight,
                    frantically doing all it can to avoid a sure death.
                    Fluttering it's wings, it soars upwards, parallel with the
                    towering figure of this pale grey titan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's arms and legs swing like pendulums, arching the
                    distances of entire villages as it walks. Feathers rain down
                    into the snow, the bluejay just slightly grazed by the
                    hulking figure. But, it continues to soar upward. It soars
                    beyond the singular glowing scarlet eye, casting a demonic
                    glow on the bluebird, painting it blood red. It soars
                    forwards, through the frozen tundra and under the brilliant
                    lights that dance in the arctic inky skies. It soars through
                    the jagged peaks mountains where few others have ventured.
                    And the bluebird lands. It lays to rest in the shadows of a
                    modest stone temple, well above the clouds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the bluebird lay dying, it is calm, for it is calm here.
                    The sounds of silence ring a pleasant melody that eases the
                    soul. It has always been peaceful here and always will be.
