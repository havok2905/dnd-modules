                        <h2>The Eye of Sel没ne</h2>
                        <p>
                            This bridge was constructed ages ago by priests of
                            the Goddess Sel没ne, goddess of knowledge and life.
                            The original elvish craftsmen are long dead, but
                            their work remains. Deep under the water, only when
                            a full moon shines overhead, do people see a bright
                            glow under the water. Those who have attempted the
                            dive to explore are said to never be seen again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In actuality, a small portal to the plane of water
                            opens under the full moon, revealing a glistening
                            tunic of silver, crafted by the priests. It is
                            guarded 24/7 by loyal merfolk, always in threes, who
                            still follow the teachings of Sel没ne. They will
                            attempt to defend it at all costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The corpses of those defeated stay for eternity in
                            the plane of water.
                        </p>

                        <EmphasisBlock>
                            Slow rolling fog creeps it's way across a circular
                            cobblestone bridge, perched just off of the rocky
                            coast. The cool earth is damp, the air misty and
                            bouncing light across the water from the moon above.
                            In the center of the bridge, a bright glow emanates
                            from deep under the water, perfectly aligned with
                            the moon.

                                This tunic was once used by servants of the high
                                priests of Sel没ne in order to conduct secret
                                business on behalf of the church.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the tunic is observed, the observer will
                                lose all memory of the creature wearing the
                                tunic at that moment in time. The memories
                                instantly disappear the moment they lose sight
                                of the creature and tunic. This includes all
                                memories of that creature before and leading up
                                to the event. This effect is permanent and
                                cannot be undone. This tunic has zero effect on
                                the creature currently wearing it, so long as
                                they can visually recognize themselves.
