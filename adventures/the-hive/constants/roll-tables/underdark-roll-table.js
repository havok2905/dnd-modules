    { rollRange: [1], description: "As the party ventures through a particularly damp passage, the ground underfoot collapses into a 30-foot deep sinkhole, have the party roll a DC13 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 Bludgeon Damage, with a critical failure leading to the character breaking a leg." },
    { rollRange: [2], description: "Cloakers in equal number to the party ambush the party. Any cloaker that misses its first attack leaves the battle and hides out of reach. Any cloaker below half HP or forcibly detached will disengage and fly away to hide." },
    { rollRange: [3], description: "As the party travels down a tunnel the ground begins to violently shake, seconds later a giant purple worm crashes through the tunnel in front of the party. It seems to be in a hurry and takes no notice of the party, leaving a new 10ft tunnel behind it." },
    { rollRange: [4], description: "The tunnel the party is travelling down is lined with veins of gold, but no apparent mining operations have taken place. The bodies of many dwarves and kobolds are scattered about. Eventually, the party comes across the remains of an Ancient Red Dragon, half-sunken into a pool of gold ore. Without mining equipment, very little of the dragon's metallurgical horde can be taken." },
    { rollRange: [5], description: "A skinny man with very little clothes on runs past the party, murmuring words about some sort of quest or unfinished duties, even if the party kills him he will run past the group again the next day." },
    { rollRange: [6], description: "The tunnel opens into a wide chamber filled with giant mushroom stalks planted in neat rows. The mushroom crops are tended by half a dozen elves who have been blinded and had their tongues cut out. They walk along the rows, feeling the stalks and plucking off insects." },
    { rollRange: [7], description: "Flowing water has formed perfect slip-and-slide channels in a steep cavern. Not only are they fun and fast, riding them is actually safer than trying to climb down the regular way. One channel, due to a tight turn, will split the group in two based on weight/speed." },
    { rollRange: [8], description: "The bones of an enormous creature are embedded in the walls of the tunnel. Ribs and a massive skull of an animal that resembled a gigantic deer poke partially out of the stone. Each one of its teeth are the size of a man's fist." },
    { rollRange: [9], description: "The group enter what appears to be a gigantic crystalline geode, and while travelling through it, come across a small band of duergar. Spell casters quickly learn that the geode crystals actually refract magical spells causing chaos on the battlefield. (Roll a percentile to see who gets hit by refracting spells.)" },
    { rollRange: [10], description: "A small group of flumphs have set up a small shop. They offer information on the general area around them. They also sell really smooth rocks for 1-3gp" }
