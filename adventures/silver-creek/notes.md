# Notes

## Side Quest Line A

Silver Mine stumbled into old artifacts of old Asmodeous cultists. It has cursed one of the miners that has fallen ill.

## Side Quest Line C

The town and bandits have been at odds as of late. The bandits have been peaceful in a truce
with the city in exchange for help fighting off the recent dragon attacks. With the latest
kidnappings, the bandits are being blamed. However, they've seen the odd movements of the cultists.
The town is shrugging off these stories as lies.
