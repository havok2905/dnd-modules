        "This tunic was once used by servants of the high priests of Sel√ªne in order to conduct secret business on behalf of the church. When the tunic is observed, the observer will lose all memory of the creature wearing the tunic at that moment in time. The memories instantly disappear the moment they lose sight of the creature and tunic. This includes all memories of that creature before and leading up to the event. This effect is permanent and cannot be undone. This tunic has zero effect on the creature currently wearing it, so long as they can visually recognize themselves."
