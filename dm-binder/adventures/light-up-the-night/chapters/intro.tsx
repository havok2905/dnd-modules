            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                A fleet of airships is illuminated by a backdrop of crimson
                skies. The desert winds tear through seas of sand, sending waves
                of dust towards the previously, proud, stone walls of Habarashi.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sun sets, casting long shadows across the desert metropolis.
                Overhead, swarms of angels, wings just as dark as these twilight
                shadows soar, above the city ruins. They align themselves with
                the borders of the city, standing guard as the fleet approaches,
                their hands gripping the hilts of their blades. Within the
                walls, mile high titans stand still, as if cast in bronze. The
                streets are now home to shrieking beasts, skin molted and bare.
                Missing, from this scene, are the men and dwarves that once
                called this place their home.
            </p>
            <p>
                You all are standing on the deck of your ship, as Habarashi
                comes into view. The banners of of your allies snap in the wind
                as you race towards battle; Habarashi's gold scales, New Fey's
                white stag, the Blood Python's serpent, Mann's spiral tower, the
                Fey Wildland's emerald tree, Sloan's scarlet dragon, and last
                but not least, the Tunnel Snake's crest, posted proudly in the
                front lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below deck, Erika is nervously adjusting the bolts on her new
                metal legs with Elsa's assistance. Sarah stares out of her
                window, with a book open, pages flipping idly with the breeze.
                It is a book she found among Diemardo's things, detailing the
                darkest things that go bump in the night. Aamon stands at
                Erika's door, is about to knock, but instead walks pensively
                back to his room. He pulls out a scroll and begins to write.
                Oddvar can be seen playing with Dennis Jr and Rodrigo in the
                cargo hold, unaware of the violence to come. Last, but not
                least, Eddard Stonecutter stands at the helm of the ship, his
                fierce glowing eyes staring out at a swirling storm of
                nightmares that looms over his former palace.
            </p>
            <p>
                So will begin the great battle of Habarashi, where blood and
                fire will fill the streets and the world's men and women fight
                one last time for their freedom.
