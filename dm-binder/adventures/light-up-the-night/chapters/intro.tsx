            <p>
                The rising sun illuminates a blanket of clouds that loom over
                the desert with a dull amber glow. Silhouetted against the sky
                are swarms of angel like creatures, all rushing to fill gaps in
                a gargantuan circle around the crumbled city walls. The royal
                palace stands as a monument to the new regime, marking the
                center of the city, and the center of a swirling black
                thunderstorm rippled with white lightning.

            <p>
                You all are standing on the deck of the ship as the city comes
                into view. The banners of of your allies snap in the wind as you
                soar towards battle; Habarashi's gold scales, New Fey's white
                stag, the Blood Python's serpent, Mann's spiral tower, the Fey
                Wildland's emerald tree, Sloan's scarlet dragon, and last but
                not least, the Tunnel Snake's crest posted proudly at the helm
                of your ship.
            </p>
            <p>
                From all sides, identical fleets quickly encroach on the walls
                and the silence of the air is broken as flaming arrows begin to
                fly. So begins the great battle of Habarashi, where blood and
                fire will fill the streets and the world's men and women fight
                one last time for their freedom.
