                <p>
                    Morning dew sparkles in the dawn, as a light breeze makes
                    it's way over the hills. Bluebirds chirp in the tall
                    branches of oak trees that line the dusty path running
                    through Andir. In the shadows of those great oaks, a couple
                    can be seen dozing off in the cool shade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The soft clattering of a cart's wheels breaks the silence,
                    the trampling of hooves creating a wake of dust behind them.
                    And as that cart rolls into town, we can now see a majestic
                    stone statue in the likeness of the half elf warrior, Edrek
                    Holderhek, founder of the town's orphanage. It now houses
                    over two hundred children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the orphanage, we see the cart come to a stop in
                    front of the iconic Shaggy Bugbear Inn. Anna, the barkeep,
                    looks up from wiping down the bar top. She's a much older
                    woman now, with streaks of white speckling her hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah, welcome back. It's been quite a while hasn't it", she
                    jests with a smile. "You haven't aged a day."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yes, it has been and, no I have not". The man replies as he
                    hoists himself up on the barstool, rhythmically tapping on
                    the bar top.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The small man sits at the bar, swinging his short legs
                    absentmindedly as he sips on a goblet of mead. Minute by
                    minute the bar comes alive. Adventurers from far and wide
                    make their way into the inn, looking for need of a rest from
                    a long day's journey. From his back, the man pulls out a
                    lute and begins to play a bright, joyous tune. As he plucks
                    the strings, a warm hum fills the ears of all who are
                    present, and the man's eyes lock with a new group of
                    wanderers, starry eyed and in search of adventure.
