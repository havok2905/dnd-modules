                    Glow of purple flame dances on the horizon, in perfect
                    unison with the dancing crowd inside the stone temple.
                    Inside a woman in robes raises a staff into the air,
                    preaching to her subjects, as they dance.

                Inside of the temple are hundreds of Enkiem's followers. They
                fled the city and now reside here. They continue to worship,
                observing from afar. If the players make themselves known as
                anything other than supporters, they will be attacked.
