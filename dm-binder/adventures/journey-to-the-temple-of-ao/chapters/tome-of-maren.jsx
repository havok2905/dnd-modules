            <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
            <EmphasisBlock>
                <p>
                    Glittering celestial script refracts silver and gold light
                    across the floors of the red stone cave. Encircling our
                    scene is row after row of dwarves and men, all staring
                    towards the center, with respect and eagerness on their
                    faces. Many are adorned in pristine white robes, crowns of
                    golden flame. Just as many wear rags, stained from a long
                    day's trek. All of them are focused on the beautiful woman
                    screaming in pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This woman is beyond gorgeous. Her long wavy sun bright hair
                    is pushed to the side. Her eyes shine with the same light as
                    the glyphs lighting the cave. At her side is a kindly
                    looking, middle aged, halfling. His hair is straw colored,
                    speckled with gray. Crows feet pull against his eyes as he
                    smiles down at the woman, and their new baby still inside
                    her womb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is one final deafening scream followed by the harsh
                    cries of a new born child, and cheering from the crowd. The
                    woman and the halfling cradle their new son in their arms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several minutes of peace go by before at the mouth of the
                    cave, a black haired woman, Enkiem, walks through. She parts
                    through the crowd and you see the mother's eyes grow wide
                    and fill with tears. Enkiem utters a single word, and like
                    dominoes, the crowd crumbles to the floor. The new father,
                    falls limp into the mother's lap, blood oozing from his open
                    mouth.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "You have committed a grave crime Maren, and have thrown
                        this plane's power wildly out of balance. Give me the
                        child."
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Still weak from child birth, Maren pushes her self backwards
                    towards the wall, using the last of her strength to pull up
                    from the rock, an elemental and a book. The elemental takes
                    the child from Maren and begins to sink down into the earth,
                    as Enkiem curses wildly. She looks back and forth, from
                    Maren, to the Elemental, and ultimately swings her scythe,
                    glowing with purple energy, down across Maren's face.

            <EmphasisBlock>
                <p>
                    The world around your blurs into a white void and a voice
                    rings out in all directions.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        "If you are reading my book, it means that my light has
                        finally burned out. Worry not though, for this is the
                        ultimate fate for those of us who ascend. And, would it
                        not have been for you, our light would never have shown
                        half as bright."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I fear though, for my period of absence. There are
                        those among us who doubt the hearts of mortals, who
                        would do all in their power to destroy you. And, while I
                        only serve a fraction of the creator's will, I refuse to
                        believe the ultimate plan is to watch you suffer. Within
                        all of you is the power to stand against us; free will.
                        We are bound by our instinctual need to serve out our
                        duties, but you are bound by no such desire. All you
                        need is a small push to fully realize all that you can
                        be. Only divine power can slay another divine being.
                        Yet, so many seem to forget that we are all, on some
                        level, divine creations."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "While I can no longer help you, a fraction of the
                        creator's spirit still lives, independent of all of us
                        who carry out it's will. There is a temple at the peak
                        of Krossa's mountains, were we have all made pilgrimage
                        when the skies glowed blue, and where Ao greets us at
                        our time of ascension."

                        both your father and I love you dearly. My only regrets
                        are never knowing the great things you are sure to
                        achieve, and not being there to teach you all that you
                        are capable of."
