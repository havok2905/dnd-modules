            <EmphasisBlock>
                <p>
                    We see a bluejay land on a crooked branch, fluttering it's
                    wings as it grips on the frail wood. It takes a moment to
                    rest it's wings, tired from a long flight through the
                    clouds. It stays perched there for some time, now dusted in
                    a thin layer of white snow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wood splinters in all directions as a mound of titanic flesh
                    rips the tree from it's roots. The bluejay takes flight,
                    frantically darting between the creature's limbs, the shower
                    of jagged stone, and finally upward, racing away from an
                    intense and sudden heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The titan's arms, swinging like iron pendulums, graze the
                    small bird, raining feathers down from above. Yet, it
                    continues to soar upward. It soars beyond the singular
                    glowing scarlet eye, painting the bird with blood red light.
                    It soars, over the frozen tundra and under the brilliant
                    lights that dance in the arctic skies. It soars through the
                    jagged peaks mountains where few others have ventured. And
                    the bluebird lands. It lays to rest in the shadows of a
                    modest stone temple, well above the clouds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is here where the bird lays to rest, looking down on the
                    realms of man, elves, and dwarves, set abalze, in chaos, and
                    torn asunder by the wrath of gods.
